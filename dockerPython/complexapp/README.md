# A little more spice

There's a hello-world app in the root folder, but this is designed to be a bit more thorough of an example.

This is a great starting example (see app2.py):
https://github.com/plotly/dash-hello-world/blob/master/app.py

The app.py and simpleapp.py files come from here:
https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-your-first-web-app-using-python-plotly-dash-and-google-sheets-api-7a2fe3f5d256
But they don't fully work since I didn't bother to register for the mapbox api per the instructions.
